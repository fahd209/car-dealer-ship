## Phase 1

I started by working on the Dealership class and my vehicle class. In my Dealer ship class i added get all vehicles functionaly, add or remove vehicles from the inventory. I added test cases for get all vehicles and add a vehicle.

## Phase 2

I added the functionalty that will allow the program to read all the data in the csv file when the application runs. I also made the application save the data that was added, or removed to the from memorey to the csv file when the application gets closed.

## Phase 3

I added the application user interface to allow the user to interacte with the application. I made the menu with all the list options for the user. 

## Phase 4

I added functionalty to the user interface dispatching commands to the application's backend allowing the user to interact with the data in the csv file.
